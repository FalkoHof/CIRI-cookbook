[circAtlas v2.0: An integrated resource of circRNAs in vertebrates.](http://circatlas.biols.ac.cn)

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a novel class of RNAs with important biological implications. Currently, a huge number of circRNAs was already identified from high-throughput RNA-seq data sets. However, functional annotation and prioritization of these circRNAs for further expreimental validation as well as functional investigation is the bottleneck step for current circRNA studies. Now, we developed a new resource database and web tool named circAtlas 2.0 that integrated over one millions of circRNAs across 6 species (human, macaca, mouse, rat, pig, chicken) and a variety of tissues. The circAtlas 2.0 can fill this gap by integrating the most comprehensive circRNAs and their expression and functional profiles in vertebrates, which provides a foundation for circRNA studies and serves as a powerful starting point to investigate their biological significance.
